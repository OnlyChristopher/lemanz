# Lemanz

A starting point for all my personal/work-related Sass projects. Feel free to pull from anything you like in this repo or not. Also includes some special JavaScript starting points as an added bonus like the jQuery plugin SVGMagic.

**Project Stack**

- Bower 1.2.8
- Sass 3.2.12 (Media Mark)
- Compass 0.12.2 (Alnilam)
- jQuery 1.10.2
- Modernizr 2.6.2
- Ruby 2.0.0p247
- Node v0.10.24

### Installation

**Install Bower Package Dependencies**

```bash
bower install
```

**Install Grunt Package Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**Notes**

- Apache config follows the HTML5 Boilerplate, but adds the ability to serve ``.svgz`` along with supporting cache busting using the method ``main.123456.css``. Also strips ``.php`` files from their file extension.
